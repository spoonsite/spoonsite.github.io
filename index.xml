      <description>1. Internal Development See User Interface Guide, Server Code Standard, and Front-end Code Standards for Coding and Style guides.
1.1 Key Components Used The following components were used in the development:
 JDK 8
 Elasticsearch/Solr
 OpenAM (Configurable, default is property based log in.)
  The application is a JEE servlet-container webapp, so any JEE 6 servlet-container compliant server should work with some server configuration. The current deployment target is Tomcat 7.</description>

      <description>1. Installation 1.1 High level instructions for a fresh install Prior to the install, setup an Elasticsearch OR Solr instance and make sure it&#39;s running. Then, perform the following steps:
 Setup VM
 Install Java JDK 1.8
 Install Tomcat 7
 Integrate OpenAM Agent

      <description>Note: The user guide is the in application help system. The files are machine read so changes to content needs to following guidelines:
 [src root]/server/openstorefront/openstorefront-web/src/main/resources/userhelp.md Sections are read from header to header The header level determines the nesting level. (Eg. h1, h2..etc) Image locations are adjusted they should follow what is currently in the document Set the security permission required on the header @ADMIN-SYSTEM-PAGE  </description>

      <description>1. Client Architecture 1.1 Client Architecture Diagram Figure 1. Client Architecture Diagram
1.2 Client Details The client core structure is based on Ext.js which provides UI components and utilities. This reduces third-part dependencies significantly which in turn reduce maintenance, learning curve and improves quality and consistency.
Added to that is application specific overrides and high-level components created to facilitate re-use. The application is composed by stripes layouts with a top-level page and fragment tool pages.</description>

      <description>Custom Submission Forms are used when you want to present a custom look and feel to the user when they submit an entry. You can add a form with many required or optional fields depending on the Entry Type of the submission. This form is then shown to the user when they are presented with the fields for a new entry of that type.

      <description>To get to the User Tools section, click on your user name in the upper right corner of the page and then select User Tools from the drop down menu. Once at the User Tools sections, click on the Submissions button and then click the New Submission button.
The process for submission depends on the type of entry you want to submit and how admin has configured your environment. The application will provide a form which will guide you through the process.</description>

      <description>The SPOON application contains a Dockerfile in order to build Docker images. There are two dockerfiles in the repo. One is for development which is used by Jenkins to deploy the application for testing of new features. The other dockerfile is for the release build. These can be found in the repo at https://github.com/spoonsite/spoon/tree/master/Docker.
SPOON also automatically builds release versions of the application for consumption by users. These builds are available on Docker Hub.</description>

      <description>Style Currently supporting IE 11, EDGE, Chrome, Firefox (latest LTS release)
Safari, Opera or others (should work but, we are not testing for them)
Project Specific  Use the Ext.js docs. Look at them first for utility functions as they are normalize for the browser. (format, string manipulation, etc&amp;hellip;).
 When making reusable components don&amp;rsquo;t use &amp;ldquo;ID&amp;rdquo;s properties. Ids are OK on individual pages; must be unique; &amp;ldquo;ID&amp;rdquo; properties are Global.</description>

      <description>This guide provide help for importing data from external sources as well as moving data from one instance to another instance.
1. Importing/Export (Third parties) The application provides set of standard format that it accepts to import Attributes/Categories as well as Entries. It also provides a set of custom formats that can have mappings applied. These custom formats allow taking a variety of data with so simple handling.

      <description>General Items  Remember this is a guide there can be variations as appropriate to the feature. Focus on the usability and having a clear workflow. Dialog bodies should be padded 10px Use toolbars for actions and enable/disable buttons to guide the user to valid actions. Add text to icons on button so it&amp;rsquo;s very clear as to what they are. (Where possible) Form action should be left to right with the Action on right and the anti-action on the left.</description>

      <description>In general, you should always upgrade one version at a time in order. (IE. going from 2.2 to 2.4 then 2.2 to 2.3 then to 2.4) That way data migrations will occur in the proper order. If you start from the lastest version and have no data then migration is not needed.
Note: 2.6.3 For existing applications:
(Update var/openstorefront/config/shiro.ini)
Add:
/login/** = anon  /mobile/** = authc  /api/v1/resource/branding/current = anon  /api/v1/resource/securitypolicy = anon  /api/v1/resource/faq/* = anon  /api/v1/resource/faq = anon  /api/v1/resource/feedbacktickets = anon  Note: 2.</description>

      <description>Java Style Guide For most part applying the IDE Formating and it&amp;rsquo;s default warning are sufficient to follow and keep the code in-line. However, here is a lists of items to follow. Borrows ideas from https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html
Special escape sequences For any character that has a special escape sequence (\b, \t, \n, \f, \r, \&amp;ldquo;, \&amp;rsquo; and \), that sequence is used rather than the corresponding octal (e.g. \012) or Unicode (e.</description>

      <description>Security Roles define what users get what permissions in the application. Several default roles are set up with default permissions and are listed below. These can be reset to default or altered as needed. New roles can also be added.

Default Roles and Resetting to Default When setting up an instance of Storefront it comes with a few default roles as described below and as shown in Admin Tools &amp;rarr; Application Management &amp;rarr; Security Roles on the website (must be logged in as an administrator to view)</description>

      <description>Note: 2.6 Introduced some UI changes however, processes and concepts are the same.
TL;DR  Administrators create and publish evaluations. Evaluators fill out evaluations. While editing an evaluation you will not see exactly what the user sees. The user sees things bundled under a Details tab and an Evaluation tab. In an evaluation everything under the Entry section applies to that Details tab while everything under the Sections and Checklist sections apply to that Evaluations tab.</description>

      <description>Question
Do sub-sections save independent of other sub-sections?
Answer
Section (Eg. Architecture) may be broken in multiple sub-section. Saving save all sub-sections. So if your are edit more than one on multiple browser tabs. Keep in mind you changes will override changes in another tab. It&amp;rsquo;s recommended to only edit in one browser tab and one browser at a time. Use change history to find resolve previous issues.
Question
What&amp;rsquo;s the difference between in Entry and Evaluation?</description>

      <description>Overview This guide goes over creating Section templates, Checklist questions and templates, and Evaluation templates. This guide assumes a librarian has a basic understanding of what an entry is and has an entry that needs to be evaluated. Once the librarian has created checklists and templates, an evaluation can be created.
Who is this for? This guide is for anyone with the role of librarian or administrator. If unsure of current role(s), contact an administrator.</description>

      <description>Overview This guide goes over the different types of publishing and the various scenarios a librarian may run into when publishing an entry/evaluation.
Different types of publishing:
 Entry publishing - publishes the entry summary only Partial publishing - publishes all default public fields except for those that have been marked as private. Full publishing - publishes all default public fields.  Reminder: an entry is a single entity that can have one to many evaluations.</description>
