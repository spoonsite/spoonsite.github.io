      <description>Evaluations Evaluations are an assessment on SPOON&amp;rsquo;s entries. There is a hierarchy of dependencies - Evaluation Templates need a Section Template and a Checklist Template, and a Checklist Template needs a Checklist Questions object. So if the Admin is making an evaluation form for the very first time, he/she will need to first create a Checklist Question, then a Checklist Template, then a Section Template.</description>
